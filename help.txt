Bahash: Baha Shell
------------------

*Requires Python 2.7 and GNU Readline to be available in your OS*

Bahash is a dead-simple shell written in Python in an attempt to learn basic shell 
construction, as well as Python as a language. It is not incredibly rigorously 
tested, and does not support clean built-in messages for most errors/exceptions, 
resulting in general error messages with tracebacks much of the time. It can, 
however, recover from most errors. 

--

Bahash currently supports the following basic features:


-Windows and Unix compatibility. Not OSX, as libedit is currently not implmented.

-Relative pathing for commands, including application execution

-Basic command expansion (such as expanding ~ to the user's home directory)

-Child process reporting, polled after each command

-History

-STDIN/STDOUT redirection
	Note: This will be buggy if you attempt to redirect both at once, or multiple
	      times on the same line.

-Quote delimiting (e.g. 'vim "file name.txt"')

-Escape characters in file name (e.g. 'vim file\ name.txt')

-Basic tab completion
	Note: Does not properly escape spaces

-Child process error logging
	Note: On by default. Errors are dumped to a childerror.log

--

Bahash currently supports the following built-in operations:


-'?' or 'help': Display this page

-'!num': Where num is an integer, repeat that line in history
	Note: The up and down cursor keys also allow you to traverse history.
	Note: !0 will run previous command

-'<' and '>': Redirect STDIN and STDOUT, respectively

-'>>': Redirect STDOUT in append mode (append output to target)

-'&': Open a process in the background

-'cd': Change directory.

-'kill(PID, SIG)': Send a process w/ Process ID PID signal SIG

-'jobs': Display a list of all child processes

-'^C': Kill all child processes

-'^D', 'quit', or 'exit': Quit the shell 
	Note: Will first warn the user of killing child processes, if any exist

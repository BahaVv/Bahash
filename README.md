# Bahash
"Baha Shell"

Initially "Bahsh" (which is an even more obnoxious name), Bahash is a simple Unix/Windows shell written in Python.

It was written with the intention of learning Python and basic shell structure in one swing. As such, it is not particularly
fast, feature rich, or thoroughly tested. 

You have been warned.
